## Demo

> To authenticate use the default credentials ***test / ApS12_ZZs8*** or create a new user on the **registration page**.

<br />

## Quick start

> UNZIP the sources or clone the repository. After getting the code, open a terminal and navigate to the working directory, with product source code.

<br />

### 👉 Set Up for `Unix`, `MacOS` 

> Install modules via `VENV`  

```bash
$ virtualenv env
$ source env/bin/activate
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

<br />

> Set Up Database

```bash
$ python manage.py makemigrations
$ python manage.py migrate
```

<br />

> Start the app

```bash
$ python manage.py runserver
```

At this point, the app runs at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`. 

> Note: To use the app, please access the registration page and create a new user. After authentication, the app will unlock the private pages.

> The bootstrap flow

- Django bootstrapper `manage.py` uses `core/settings.py` as the main configuration file
- `core/settings.py` loads the app magic from `.env` file
- Redirect the guest users to Login page
- Unlock the pages served by *app* node for authenticated users
